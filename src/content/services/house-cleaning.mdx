## What do house cleaning services include?

House cleaning services cover all the areas of your house, deep cleaning of individual rooms or appliances, and related tasks. Whether you need someone to handle spring cleaning or an expert who can make your home spotless after you move out, there’s a Tasker nearby who’s ready to help you. Taskers bring their equipment and cleaning solutions when accomplishing a job, though you can ask them to use what you have at home.

### Cleaning the bathroom

Professional house cleaning usually starts in the most labour-intensive room: the bathroom. This tiny space has a lot of different surfaces and kinds of dirt that will need to be scrubbed out, like tile grout and water deposits on showerheads.

Though the specifics may vary from Tasker to Tasker, they usually clean the ceilings and walls, scrub the tiles, wipe down countertops and cabinets, and clean any mats or rugs. They also clean the shower, toilet, and bathtub, getting rid of any unsightly stains. They also polish faucets and mirrors and dispose of the trash. Taskers can also change the towels for you, upon request.

### Cleaning the living room and common areas

The service usually involves the living room and other common areas you may have, such as hallways and the dining room. Cleaners sweep the cobwebs and any ceiling dust, then wipe down all exposed surfaces, such as couches, tables, and shelves. Any mirrors, picture frames, and other decorations will also be dusted. They also sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors, then clean out your wastebaskets.

### Cleaning the bedrooms

Similar to cleaning the living room and common areas, cleaners wipe down surfaces, clean the fixtures and embellishments, and sanitise the floor. To save more time, you can also have your Tasker change the bed linen and handle the laundry.

### Cleaning the kitchen

You can expect your Tasker to clean your kitchen’s ceiling, walls, and floor. They also wipe the exteriors of appliances, such as your range and dishwasher. This service also covers dusting your tables and chairs, cleaning any items on display, cleaning your sink and drip pans, and disposing of your trash. Cleaners usually include shining your faucets and fixtures as part of the kitchen cleaning checklist.

### Deep cleaning

Deep cleaning your house is no easy feat. This process involves more equipment, different types of cleaning solutions, and a lot of elbow grease. That’s where Airtasker comes in. You can hire a house cleaning service near you to handle chores like cleaning the inside of your oven, dusting each cupboard in your pantry, and cleaning your carpets. This intensive routine is ideal for when you’re moving house or if you’re cleaning a commercial establishment like an office or restaurant kitchen.

### What Are the House Cleaning Prices In The Brisbane?

The house cleaning prices on the Brisbane range from $28 to $50/hr. You can also typically expect flat rate domestic pricing from $70 to $220 for weekly and monthly cleans. Prices for bond cleans are generally from $150 to $800 depending on the size of the home.
