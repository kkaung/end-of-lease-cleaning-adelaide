Depending on your office usage, you’ll likely need a regular office clean anywhere from daily to weekly. Or you might hire an office cleaner for occasional cleanings - like when you move offices after you throw an office party, or when an important client is coming to visit. A standard office cleaning service will usually include the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Remove rubbish\n\nYour office cleaner will remove waste from bins in each office and under each desk. They’ll also remove the rubbish from any kitchen and bathroom bins. They’ll discretely cart all the office rubbish to the main bins located outside, replacing bin liners as they go.\n\n### Step 2: Clean floors\n\nOffice cleaning will always include vacuuming the floors, focusing on high-traffic areas. Your cleaner will spot-clean any visible stains to prevent setting. Then they’ll mop any hard floor areas using a steam mop or mop and bucket, putting up “wet floor” signs in case any employees are in the office.\n\n### Step 3: Clean staff kitchen and bathrooms\n\nYour office cleaner will ensure clean tables, benchtops, and floors in your staff kitchen area. Most staff are expected to wash and dry their own dishes, but your professional cleaner may include this service, or assist with packing and unpacking the dishwasher. In your staff bathrooms, they’ll clean each toilet, wipe down the sinks and benches, and mop the floors. They’ll use “wet floor” signs ensure staff and visitors don’t slip over.\n\n### Step 4: Wipe desks, windows, and other surfaces\n\nFinally, they’ll clean any remaining surfaces that get used regularly, focusing on desks, tables, fans, and windows. Your office cleaner will use window cleaning spray and paper towel to remove marks from internal window surfaces, plus any glass partitions and panels. They’ll also disinfect door handles to ensure a hygienic environment and hopefully minimise the spread of sickness in your workplace.\n\n## Experience the Pro Cleaning Brisbane Difference\n\nIf you're ready to experience the transformative power of a professional office cleaning service, look no further than Pro Cleaning Brisbane.
