However, at Berry Cleaning Brisbane, we strive to offer competitive and transparent pricing for our professional bond cleaning services.\n\n### Factors Influencing the Cost\n\n#### Property Size\n\nThe overall square footage of the rental property is a major determinant of the bond cleaning cost. Larger homes or apartments generally require more time and effort to clean thoroughly, resulting in higher costs.\n\n#### Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms\n\nProperties with more bedrooms and bathrooms typically incur higher bond cleaning fees due to the increased cleaning requirements in these high-traffic areas.\n\n#### Condition of the Property\n\nIf the rental property has been heavily soiled or neglected during the tenancy, it may require more intensive cleaning efforts, which can drive up the cost of the bond clean.\n\n#### Additional Services\n\nSome tenants may require additional services beyond the standard bond clean, such as carpet cleaning, window cleaning, or oven detailing. These extras can increase the overall cost.\n\n### Transparent Pricing Policy\n\nAt Berry Cleaning Brisbane, we believe in providing upfront, honest pricing with no hidden fees. To give you an idea, our bond cleaning services typically start at around $250 for a standard 2-bedroom apartment or unit. However, we recommend requesting a personalized quote to get an accurate estimate based on your specific property's size and condition.\n\nRest assured, our experienced bond cleaners work efficiently to deliver exceptional results while keeping our prices competitive and fair. We understand the importance of getting your full bond back, and we strive to make our services accessible and affordable for all tenants in the Brisbane area.\n\n<Reviews\n    items={[\n        {\n            name: 'Scott',\n            review: 'We needed an end of lease cleaning.
